# Algorithms for Conjunctive Queries
## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor of Science (BSc) thesis on "Algorithms for Conjunctive Queries." This thesis explores the fundamental problem of efficiently querying databases using conjunctive queries and presents two main algorithms that were implemented to tackle this challenge.
## About this thesis
Conjunctive queries are a fundamental concept in the field of databases and play a crucial role in information retrieval. A conjunctive query is a query that consists of a sequence of conditions, and the result is obtained by finding records that satisfy all of these conditions. The problem lies in efficiently processing these queries, especially when dealing with large-scale databases.

This thesis aims to address this challenge by proposing and implementing innovative algorithms that can significantly improve the performance of conjunctive queries in a database. The focus is on reducing query processing time and resource utilization while maintaining accurate and reliable results.
